Creating an Angular app instructions.

Download angular cli

create new project folder.

cd into your project folder.

RUN:  ng new public
    add angular routing (css)
    -----this will build the public folder in your project where you will work on your app-----

cd into public.

RUN: ng build --watch
    (keep this running and open a separate terminal to continue)

in your new terminal window, cd into your main project folder where you have your server.js file.

open your server.js file and add in the following line:

        app.use(express.static( __dirname + '/public/dist/public' ));

Now we need to add SERVICE to our angular app.

aka, we need to create a connection to our data (MODELS)

    This is where Observables and Subscribes come into play.
    
    Observables are variables we create and 'send-out' to collect data from our database via AJAX.
    Observables have a built in subscribe method that allow us to 'listen' for that data to come back.

    Once we receive the data back, we can run a function using that data.

ADDING SERVICE:

cd into the public folder.

RUN: ng g s http
    (this means "generate service" and call it "http")
    (why call it http? to make our lives simpler I suppose)

we now have a new file called "http.service.ts"  (ts stands for typescript)

we will access this file elsewhere and use it to connect to our database.



::::::IN THE APP.MODULE.TS FILE::::::
Go to your app.module.ts file (should be in public/src/app)
Import your new HttpService class with: '''' import { HttpService } from './http.service'; ''''

Add the HttpService class to your list of providers in the app.module.ts file.

Now import the built in Angular class HttpClientModule with: '''' import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; ''''

Add the HttpClientModule class to your list of imports in the app.module.ts file.

import the following at the top:
'''''  import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';  '''''
and add to your list of imports.



For any models you have that involve CRUD applications ... you will create
new components using the following command:

''''' ng generate component component_name ''''''

Once your components are generated, you will need to add them as dependecies in different files.

example:
'''''  import { TaskComponent } from './task/task.component';  '''''
adding TaskComponent to the list of declarations.



::::::IN THE HTTP.SERVICE.TS FILE::::::
THIS IS WHERE WE WILL CONNECT TO OUR SERVER'S ROUTES AND GET/POST THE DATA

Now import the built in Angular class HttpClient into your http.service.ts file:
    '''' import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; ''''

Add the HttpClient class to your list of imports in the app.module.ts file.

We will be creating methods here that return responses from our http requests.




::::::IN THE APP.COMPONENT.TS FILE::::::
THIS IS WHERE WE ESTABLISH OBSERVABLES AND SEND INSTRUCTIONS TO OUR HttpService CLASS!!!
WE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR OBSERVABLES AND PROCESS THE DATA WHEN IT IS RETURNED.


import the HttpService class at the top with: ''''' import { HttpService } from './http.service'; '''''

add the following inside your constructor method parameters: ''''  private _httpService: HttpService  ''''
